- File _CURVE_MATCHING WIDGET_ is a Jupyter Notebook  uses ipy widgets to aid in curve matching and calculate _T & S_
- File _Curve Matching Plotly_ is a Jupyter Notebook which uses plotly library to match  the curve (the following is not a fully automatic process) where the user gets the experience closest to physically matching the type curve and the measured data 
- File _ Theisapp_ uses the streamlit library to create a Cloud based app, which can be accessed from [here](https://inux-project-theis-curve-matching-theisapp-pjiigc.streamlit.app/) The app aims to provide an experience combining the advantages of both the above mentioned Jupyter Notebooks
